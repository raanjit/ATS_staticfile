                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">You must provide us accurate information when you create your TrackTalents account. Your TrackTalents account gives you access to the Service. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of users or organizations. When you connect to TrackTalents through a Third Party Service, you thereby give us permission to access and use your information from that Third Party Service (on such terms as are permitted by that service), and to store your log-in credentials for that service. You may never use another user's account without permission. </p>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with TrackTalents or a Third Party Service.

TrackTalents cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. You must notify TrackTalents immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

We warrant that we have adequate security measures in place to comply with the above obligations and to ensure that access granted hereunder will not impair the integrity and availability of your Systems.</p>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">
                    We shall implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards that are designed to prevent any unauthorized use, access, processing, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of any of your data (including any applicant or employee data furnished by you as may be held or accessed by us). And we shall notify you as soon as reasonably possible following discovery of any suspected breach or compromise of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your data.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">9. Confidential Information</h4>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">You agree that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information which you obtain from us is our confidential property ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified in writing as confidential at the time of disclosure or, if disclosed verbally, is identified as confidential in writing within thirty (30) days of the disclosure. You will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. But your non-disclosure obligations shall not apply to information which you can document: i) was rightfully in your possession or known to you prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; ii) is or has become public knowledge otherwise than through your fault; iii) is rightfully obtained by you from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; iv) is independently developed by your employees whom had no access to such information; or v) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the disclosing party).</p>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">The terms of any agreement between you and TrackTalents shall be deemed confidential information of TrackTalents without any further marking or designation.</p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">10. TrackTalents Property, Copyrights, and Feedback</h4>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">All right, title, and interest in and to the Service (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of TrackTalents and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries.

                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">11. Acceptable Use of TrackTalents</h4>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">TrackTalents is trusted by its users, and we trust you to use our Service responsibly. You agree not to misuse the Service. For example, you must not, and must not attempt to do the following things: use the Service for any unlawful purposes or for promotion of illegal activities; post any Content on the Service in violation of any applicable law, including intellectual property laws and right of privacy or publicity laws, or any contractual obligation; impersonate others through the Service or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse, or deceive others; publish or post other people's private or personally identifiable information, such as credit card numbers, street address or Social Security/National Identity numbers, without their express authorization and permission; send spam; publish or link to malicious content intended to damage or disrupt another user's browser or computer or to compromise a user's privacy; access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Service, TrackTalents's computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of TrackTalents's providers; probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; access or search the Service by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces (for example, "scraping"); forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Service to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; interfere with, or disrupt, the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Service, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Service. International users agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content. </p>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">We may investigate and/or suspend your account if you violate any of the above rules. Furthermore, we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account without further notice in the event that, in our sole and absolute judgment, you violate these Terms, or abuse the Service.</p>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">Some use of our Service may require you to download a client software package ("Software"). TrackTalents hereby grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Service. Your license to use the Software is automatically revoked if you violate these Terms in a manner that implicates our intellectual property rights. You must not reverse engineer or decompile the Software, nor attempt to do so, nor assist anyone else to do so. Our Service may update the Software on your device automatically when a new version is available. </p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">12. Third-Party Links</h4>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you (for example via email to the email address associated with your account). Other changes may be posted to our blog or Terms page, so please check those pages regularly. By continuing to access or use the Service after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Services.</p>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">The Service may have links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by us. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any of these third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access a third party website from the Service, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these Terms and our Privacy Policy do not apply to your use of those sites. You expressly relieve TrackTalents from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, service, or content and agree that your dealings with any third-party website, service, or content is only between you and such third parties. You agree that we are not responsible for any loss or damage of any sort in your dealings with such third parties. Many of these third party services expressly disclaim all warranties, support or other liabilities or obligations to you in respect of their software or service. For example, Tableau requires us to communicate to you that they shall have no warranty, support or other obligation or liability to you in respect of your use of its software. You should read the applicable Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of any third party link or service before using it.</p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">13. Modifications</h4>

Other changes may be posted to our blog or Terms page, so please check those pages regularly. By continuing to access or use the Service after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service.</p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">14. Indemnity</h4>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold TrackTalents, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, suppliers, licensors and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Service (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action ("Claim"), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">15. Entire Agreement</h4>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">These Terms (including any amendments, order forms, and any additional agreements you enter into with TrackTalents in connection with the Service) and the Privacy Policy (which is hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference) will constitute the entire agreement ("Agreement") between TrackTalents and you with respect to the subject matter contemplated herein, and supersede all oral statements and prior writings with respect to the subject matter contemplated herein. This Agreement is entered into after full investigation by each party, and neither party is relying on any statement or representation made by the other not embodied in this Agreement. If any provision of these Terms shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in effect. No waiver shall be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under these Terms. Nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claiming to have waived.</p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">16. No Warranty - TrackTalents is Available "AS-IS"</h4>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">Though we want to provide a great service, there are certain things about the Service we can't promise. The service and software are provided "as is", and to the fullest extent permitted by law, neither tracktalents, its agents, affiliates, licensors, nor suppliers, make any warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use, and non-infringement. tracktalents makes no representations about any content or information in, or from, an end user or customer services account. TrackTalents is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of data, user posts, or any other information posted by a user. </p>
                <p class="weight400 color1 space30">TrackTalents will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Service or Software.</p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">17. Limitation of Liability</h4>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will tracktalents, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable for (a) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential (including loss of use, data, business, or profits) damages, regardless of legal theory, whether or not tracktalents has been warned of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose; (b) aggregate liability for all claims relating to the service more than the greater of $20 or the amounts paid by you to tracktalents for the past three months of the service in question. </p>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States. We make no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.</p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">18. Notice</h4>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">
                    We may provide notifications, whether these are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by us in our sole discretion.
                </p>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">
                    Any notice provided to TrackTalents hereunder shall be in writing to the notice address set forth above and shall be deemed given: i) upon receipt, if by personal delivery; ii) upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered US Mail (return receipt requested); or iii) one (1) day after it is sent, if by next day delivery by a major commercial delivery service. Notices sent via email are deemed received at the time that the notices are sent.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">19. Miscellaneous</h4>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">
                    All sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination of any agreement between you and TrackTalents, will survive termination, including, without limitation, restrictions, accrued rights to payment, confidentiality obligations, intellectual property rights, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
                </p>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without our written permission, but may be assigned by us without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment by you will be null and void.</p>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">No supplement, modification, or amendment of these Terms shall be binding unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party.</p>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">Neither TrackTalents nor Customer will be liable for inadequate performance to the extent caused by a condition that was beyond the party's reasonable control (for example, natural disaster or Internet disturbance).</p>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">TrackTalents may suspend performance under these Terms if: (i) you are in material breach and fail to cure that breach within 30 days after the receipt of written notice or (ii) you cease business operations or become subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days.</p>
                <p class="weight400 nrml_font color1 space30">Termination is not an exclusive remedy and the exercise of TrackTalents by any remedy under these Terms will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under these Terms, by law, or otherwise.</p>
                <h4 class="mn-h20 weight600 color1 space15">20. Arbitration</h4>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">In the unlikely event that TrackTalents has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any TrackTalents claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in the city of Plano, Texas, under the commercial rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The prevailing party will be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and costs in connection with such an action.</p>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing TrackTalents from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of TrackTalents's proprietary interests. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, all remedies are cumulative and in addition to (not in lieu of) any other remedies available to a party at law or equity.</p>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">All claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. you agree that, by using the service, you and tracktalents are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. </p>
                <p class="color1 nrml_font mrb-30">You agree that the Service is based in Texas; and these Terms are governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Texas, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. </p>
